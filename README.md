This repository builds Vanilla Dpup using latest [woof-CE](https://github.com/puppylinux-woof-CE/woof-CE) on Saturdays.

Unlike [stable releases](https://github.com/vanilla-dpup/releases/releases) of Vanilla Dpup, this repository contains unstable and dangerous, early development builds of Vanilla Dpup 10.0; **use them at your own risk**.

If you find any issues, please report them at [woof-CE](https://github.com/puppylinux-woof-CE/woof-CE/issues). Thank you!
